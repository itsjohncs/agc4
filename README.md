# Anti-Gravity Connect 4

## What is AGC4?

This is a game that grew out of a desire to play something similar to Connect Four, but different. The game is similar in that each player is trying to form a row, column, or diagonal of four of their color. Where this game deviates is where the players are allowed to place pieces: a piece may only be placed in a square which is connected to a continuous straight non-diagonal line of pieces to a wall.

## History

I created this Flash game in high school after coming up with the game idea in my math class and playing it with my classmates on graph paper.
